Untitled Space Miner Game

The Galactic Wars have ended, but the devastation caused by the <Bug creatures name here> has left the colonies in ruins. 
Now, everyone is trying to rebuild.

You are a member of <Crew name here>, a mining team dedicated to salvaging resources by repairing war-torn drills.

The locations of valuable resources have been identified, but reaching them won't be easy.

The <Bug creatures name here> have infested most colonies, and you'll need to use your trusty spacerig to clear them out 
while protecting the drone that repairs the drills.

You also much watch out for space pirates, and maintaining your ship. Either can make you lose resources!

You've also arrived at a crucial moment—the new galactic stock market has just launched! 
Will you invest in resources for upgrades to bypass the grind, or risk losing everything in the market's fluctuations?
